 echo.6.t:0 "New Player Readme"
 echo.6.d:0 "There are many changes in this mod, but the main ones are:\n\nBeing over Governing Capacity now has severe penalties. Being under Governing Capacity gives a scaling -10% Development Cost at max.\n\nKent and Calais is now a land connection. Gibraltar and Ceuta is now a land connection. Tajura and Mukha is now a land connection. Hormuz and Mogostan and Qawasim are now land connections.\n\nHordes have 100% Cav Ratio and 100 Horde Unity for the duration of the first age, after which their Horde Unity will begin ticking down and their max Cav Ratio will be 75%. Hordes will need to reform into one of their formables to maintain their stability.\n\nSeveral Building Slot Decisions added which show inefficient buildings in the province.\n\nThe Merchant Guild Financial Demand privilege now can be revoked for -10 Burgher Loyalty after cooldown.\n\nEstate loyalty equilibrium is now 50 but Estate Privileges no longer give loyalty.\n\nYou can recruit any advisor using the "Recruit X Advisor" type decision.\n\nYou can create trade centres using the "Create a Trade Centre" decision. Trade Centres now scale to level 4. \n\nYou can improve Wool, Grain, Naval Supplies or Livestock provinces if developed sufficiently using the "Issue Provincial Assessment" decision.\n\nIf you break alliance with a country, you cannot re-ally it until the "Broke Alliance" opinion modifier has ticked down to 0. This is usually 5 years, but is effected by Improve Relations. \n\nMilitary Advisor Events have been locked until Miltary Tech 9 is unlocked and can be fired once every 100 years.\n\nEstate mana privileges have been completely removed from the game and you now start at 5 crownland.\n\nThe Nobility estate privilege: Force Conscription now gives you 2 Yearly Manpower at 100 Influence.\n\nEvery country can explore via decision and colonise after Dip Tech 6, after which the New World may be colonised.\n\nArmy Tradition now provides 15% Forcelimit at 100, scaling with tradition.\n\nMilitary Technology bonuses are more spread out over the course of the game.\n\n\nBuildings:\nArmoury building added that gives +3 Forcelimit and requires 30 Development (of which 10 is Manpower Development) and the Provinces in the whole state to have a Regimental Camp (or Upgraded Version). Buildings now give a small -1.25% Dev Cost per building up to 6 buildings max. Courthouses reduce the terrain development penalty depending on terrain.\n\nRegimental Camps provide an extra bonus on Grain provinces. Barracks provide a flat 250 Manpower on livestock provinces. Please note if you are using any mods that increase interface size, you may not be able to see the Armoury building.\n\n\n\nTriggered Modifiers:\nThere are several Critical Provinces which give military bonuses for owning. Hover over this decision requirements to highlight their locations.\n\nRising Power: Gives Strong Economic bonuses for countries under 400 Total Development.\n\nSplendid Court: Gives a small Economic Bonus in Age of Discovery if you have at least one level 3 advisor."\n\nImperial Dominance: Gives -0.5 AT and NT decay to the Top 3 Great Powers."\n\nIf you have this modifier for 10 years and you have remained under your Governing Capacity for the duration, you will receive a further 400 Governing Capacity and +1 Accepted Cultures until the end of the game."
 #echo.6.d:0 "How new Mercs work:\n \n Mercs = Revolutionary Guard Regiments (Inf, Cav, Arty)\n\n Every country can recruit them but has no FL yet. If at war with another player a decision becomes aviable that gives you Rev. Guard (Mercs) Fl Fraction. How much FL Fraction you get depends on your total Dev (larger dev nations have more FL so they get LESS Fl fraction). \n\n The larger your nation the more do the Mercs Cost and the slower they reeinforce. \n\n Upon pressing the decision to get Merc FL you get flat manpower (scales with your total dev) instantly. The manpower has 10 years cooldown and is ment to be used to hire the new mercs. Exactly how much manpower you get scales with your total dev but the scaling gets worse the more total dev you have.\n\n You Recruit mercs like normal units but have maxed out recruitment time as long as you are at war after pressing the decision\n\n. Once you are at peace a event will make the mercs useless so you dont start a player war just to get mercs to then use against AI or stuff."

One of the largest empires in history, it was, in conjunction with the Portuguese, the first to usher the European Age of Discovery and achieve a global scale, controlling vast portions of the Americas, the archipelago of Philippines, various islands in the Pacific and territories in Western Europe and Africa. It was one of the world's most powerful empires of the early modern period, becoming known as 'the empire on which the sun never sets' and reached its maximum extent in the 18th century."

 flavor_trs.53.d:0 "Our new investments in the development of [1973.GetName] have paid off, as the city continues to gain wealth and size, we now have the ability to look towards the future. Even now many question if we should use our newfound production capabilities to focus on producing different kinds of trade goods in our capital. Perhaps we should look to producing goods that will stand a better chance of generating profit in the future. Many have been suggesting to focus on the processing of raw material imported from the mines of Upper Transoxiana, while others wish to establish new manufactories for the production of cloth or glass, that would rival even the famed Bohemian and Venetian works. What shall we do?"
