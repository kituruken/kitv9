 transoxiana_beijing_samarkand_pact_desc: "We've been a close trade partner with the Chinese Emperors for ages.

Famine plagued men in likeness to disease, both ravaging each street they galloped throughout the city. The stricken people of the Pearl of Khorasan were under unbearable stress as the weight of heaven itself began pushing down on their shoulders, just as hell rose up to greet their sodden corpses. Surrender was imminent, and the gates of Herat opened to be greeted by an equally tumultuous fate. What once was considered Shah Rukh's golden jewel in the deserts of Persia is now reduced to the ashes and cinder of lost hope, shattered dreams, and a dead city."

 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTDESC3: "Atop the rich throne of Transoxiana sits grandson of Tamerlane, Ulugh Beg himself. Among the princes of the Timurid Empire, Beg was in perhaps the best position in 1444. He exerted considerable influence over the Silk Road, controlling one of its main stops: Samarkand. The only true danger to Transoxiana was the Uzbek Horde, which launched dozens of border raids of the years. The Chagatai sit to the east, weakened and ripe for the taking. To our west, the Khorasani wait patiently for the death of Shah Rukh, though hardly in a state to begin their conquests. Ulugh Beg is the only prince in a truly favorable position, which he will undoubtedly use to his advantage."

 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTDESC4: "Babur bin Baysunkur, also known as Abul-Qasim Babur Mirza, was perhaps the greatest strategist of the Timurid brothers. Though his holdings were relatively small, he would move on to defeat the Transoxianians in combat, nearly restoring the Timurid Empire to its height under Shah Rukh. Khorasan sits in a somehwat troubling position: a handful of Persian nations to the west offer promising expansion, but if we cannot deal with Ulugh Beg, he will surely spell our downfall."

 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTNAME6: "Heir of the Shah?"
 ME_Timurid_Princes_Event.EVTDESC6: "Ulugh Beg, born of Shah Rukh, remains the last truly legitimate successor to the Timurid Empire. Alongside the collapse of Rukh's empire was a power vacuum, which we succesfully filled with our own image of greatness. The time has come to proclaim ourselves the next Timurid Empire and continue the task of Tamerlane."

 transoxiana_deal_with_khorasan_desc: "Babur bin Baysunkur of the Timurid Dynasty is one of the most rowdy and powerful contestants to the Timurid Throne. Furthermore, our rivalry has demonstrated itself in various skirmishes and conflicts between us. It is time to deal with Babur once for all! There is only one heir of Shah Rukh and that is Ulugh Beg!"
 transoxiana_reintegrate_the_governor_of_qom_title: "Re-Integrating the Traitor"
 transoxiana_reintegrate_the_governor_of_qom_desc: "With Babur handled, it is time to end the rule of the descendants of Muhammad bin Baysonqor - one of the rebels to Shah Rukh's rule and certainly an indirect cause to his death. By rebelling, he brought shame upon his branch of the family and his posessions should now be reintegrated into the proper Timurid Empire."

 transoxiana_usurp_the_throne_desc: "With beloved Shah Rukh dead and his illegitimate heir removed from the Timurid Throne, it's time for Ulugh Beg to usurp his rightful position as the new Timurid Emperor. Originally given to Ulugh Beg, the title of heir to the Timurid Empire was unjustly snapped up by Ala al-Dawla Abd Allah Timurid. Fortunately, his rule is now over and the Timurid Scepter may soon lie in the hands of Ulugh Beg."

 transoxiana_rival_the_hordes_title: "Taming the Hordes"
 transoxiana_rival_the_hordes_desc: "Rule over Mavarannahr brings great power, but with it comes the great danger. Indoubtedly, we are the buffer state between the heart of the Empire and the wicked hordes of the north that are looking for an opportunity to sack the thriving cities of Samarkand and Herat. These vile nomads must be dealt with. "
 transoxiana_adopt_turkoman_tactics_title: "Turkoman Tactics"
 transoxiana_adopt_turkoman_tactics_desc: "While we have been using the infamous 'Hit and Run' tactics for ages, the traditional Turkoman tactic has been falling out of use recently. We should perfect the tactics instead."
 transoxiana_subjucate_afghanistan_title: "A Letter to Afghanistan"
 transoxiana_subjucate_afghanistan_desc: "The Sheikhdom of Afghanistan is placed in a highly strategic position. The current Sheikh ruling in Kabul is nothing but a mere impostor of a ruler. Let us send an offer to the Afghani Monarch offering him vassalization, if he accepts, we will recognize him as a worthy ruler and that we will protect them in his hardships."
 transoxiana_reclaim_sistan_title: "Reclamation of Sistan"
 transoxiana_reclaim_sistan_desc: "Sistan has always been part of Timur's Empire. However, since the fall of Herat and the imminent collapse of the Timurid Administration, the Mihrabanids have been free from the shackles. It is time to restore the Timurid rule over Sistan."
 transoxiana_arrival_of_abu_said_title: "The Arrival of Abu Sa'id"
 transoxiana_arrival_of_abu_said_desc: "Abu Sa'id Mirza is seeming to be a pearl among great men. We ought to employ this skilled man and let him run the Army Drill inside our armies. We shan't waste this opportunity."
 transoxiana_a_possible_traitor_title: "A Possible Traitor?"
 transoxiana_a_possible_traitor_desc: "Abu Sa'id Mirza, though a person of great help in the court and a skilled instructor, is also of great danger to the state. Word has reached [Root.Monarch.GetName] that he is planning to raise the banner of rebellion and use the Afghani tribesmen to storm Samarkand. We shall tread carefully and be ready to supress any rebellion, providing gossips are true."
 transoxiana_suleymans_range_fortifications_title: "Mountain Fortifications"
 transoxiana_suleymans_range_fortifications_desc: "As it currently stands, our eastern flank is frequently getting raided by minor Indian Chiefs. This must stop! To protect us from being attacked in times of need, we shall construct forts on the border with India, little price to pay for salvation. "
